"""
Write a function that takes text as parameters and a list of words to censor in it. For example, the word "kvaraba"
is a terrible swear word, and we need to replace it with k*****a in the given text. Start something like this:

def censor(text, *curses):
    # this will be your function

# after calling a function, eg:
censor('horrible words like kvaraba, snakes..', 'kvaraba', 'snakes')
# would be printed for us
# scary words like k*****a, Å¾****s..
use regex to censor words and use .replace() to replace them in text
